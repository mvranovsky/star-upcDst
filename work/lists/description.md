Name of embedding of JPsi file (100k events):

```bash
/star/u/mvranovsk/star-upcDst/work/lists/embeddingJPsi.upcDst.root
```

List of all *.root* files for Run17

```bash
/star/u/mvranovsk/star-upcDst/work/lists/fullRun17.list
```

Good runs for analysis without the Roman Pots and with:

```bash
/star/u/mvranovsk/star-upcDst/work/lists/goodRun17noRP.list
/star/u/mvranovsk/star-upcDst/work/lists/goodRun17WithRP.list
```

For testing, use 2 files:

```bash
/star/u/mvranovsk/star-upcDst/work/lists/18119020_ZB.root
/star/u/mvranovsk/star-upcDst/work/lists/18148031.root
```

the first one contains a lot of zerobias events used mainly for testing zerobias analysis, the second one contains at least 1 JPsi candidate. Luminosities are loaded from files 

```bash
/star/u/mvranovsk/star-upcDst/work/lists/lum_perrun_JPsi_HTTP.txt
/star/u/mvranovsk/star-upcDst/work/lists/luminosityForZB.list
```
